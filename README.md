# word-guess-game

#This is a traditional hang-man style game.

#The player has 15 letter guesses to figure out the word.

#If the word is guessed correctly, the band name will appear and a video of their performance.

#The player can then play again and guess the next word.

#If the word is not guessed within 15 guesses, an alert will appear stating they did not guess correctly and giving the option to play again.
